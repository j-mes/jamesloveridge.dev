			<h1>Hello there…</h1>
<p>I'm a Deaf Software Engineer who breaks things for a living at the FT. Formerly a grumpy commuter and a tormented Arsenal fan.</p>

			</a>

			<p>Thankfully this week has not been -5°C and has been relatively warm. However this is January, it is meant to be freezing all month, it worries me what the temperatures will be like in the future. It's absolutely fascinating how a single character change at work from a system further upstream from Lantern or Pink Lantern can just break things.&hellip;</p>
