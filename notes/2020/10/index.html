				<h1>25+13 &amp; 5Â½</h1>
				<p>Yesterday I added another year's experience of being 25 with a mental age of 5Â½. So this is bit of a reflective note this week based on the last five years that I've been doing professionally.</p>
<p>To start with, 5 years ago, I was predominantly a front end developer, and to an extent, only specialised in doing HTML and CSS (eventually with Sass as well). I was really adamant that I would not do any JavaScript as I believed in that a lot of things could be achieved with HTML/CSS on its own or with a CMS like WordPress or others. That kind of mindset is admirable even today, I can see that there were drawbacks to that approach. Deciding early on that JavaScript was not a good thing to learn was possibly not a great move on my behalf.</p>
<p>After completing the Masters' at University of Greenwich, I learnt the value of networking with people in the same industry as me. This was massively valuable as after following a few developers, I came across a retweet which showed me a job opportunity at the Financial Times. It was an internship position, and I felt it was a good opportunity and that I could use that opportunity to learn from other developers, as apart from the Masters' I had not a lot of opportunities to work with other developers. This would allow me to learn from them outside of reading about their experiences when they wrote about it online.</p>
<p>Working in the Origami team at the FT for 3 months, was massively invaluable to me. I <em>learnt</em> a lot, and will always be grateful to the developers in Origami at the time. I was exposed to what was considered to be the way of doing things, and experimenting with things were not frowned upon, but encouraged as it would provide a learning experience. As the short-term contract ended, I went to a web agency where I would learn a lot about WordPress, client and time management. There were a lot of lessons learnt at this job, and I'm grateful for those lessons as well. I feel that I'm more well rounded as a front end developer at the end of my time there.</p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years later, I was given the opportunity to work at the FT again, but as a permanent employee, and I feel it is the place where I have found myself growing as a person and as a professional the most for the last year and half. Following a recent discussion with a principal engineer who also is a mentor to me, she has pointed out that if I looked back to day 1 of the job and to now, I'd realise that I've grown exponentially in a lot of areas, I will always be grateful to all of the Internal Products folks for allowing me this opportunity and to grow as a person as well.</p>
<p>The biggest gotcha for me in the last 5 years is thisâ€¦ how much I love working with JavaScript daily compared to back in 2015! Until then ðŸ‘‹</p>
