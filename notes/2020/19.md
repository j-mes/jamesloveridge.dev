Well, for a number of weeks I haven't really felt like documenting or writing week notes. The massive life shift with the pandemic has been a challenge to adapt to, and unfortunately my weeknotes fell by the side. The FT has made the ['Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreads'](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest) article free for anyone to read and consume, and it is regularly up to date. I hope to not write anything more further about coronavirus in the weeknotes from now.

## Deaf Awareness Week

Last week I published two Medium posts for Deaf Awareness Week (4th-10th May 2020) and was interviewed by Product & Technology's Talent Acquisition team for the 'Future Leaders' series which people get invited to interview to cover a person's perspective, and how they got into technology in the first place.

So, without further ado, here's the links to the articles!

* [Helping people learn sign language at work](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/helping-people-learn-sign-language-at-work-79d8e0336aa8)
* [Communication tips with Deaf people at work](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/communication-tips-with-deaf-people-at-work-fd7b172e0e1c)

## Future weeknotes

The next few weeknotes will be more of an explanatory of the learning journey I undergo with AWS (Amazon Web Services) for work. I hope to make it a version of a glossary that could be explained to a five year old, and would be useful for future me as well.

Until then 👋
