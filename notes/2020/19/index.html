				<h1>Lack of updates &amp; DAW</h1>
				<p>Well, for a number of weeks I haven't really felt like documenting or writing week notes. The massive life shift with the pandemic has been a challenge to adapt to, and unfortunately my weeknotes fell by the side. The FT has made the <a href="https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest">'Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreads'</a> article free for anyone to read and consume, and it is regularly up to date. I hope to not write anything more further about coronavirus in the weeknotes from now.</p>
<h2>Deaf Awareness Week</h2>
<p>Last week I published two Medium posts for Deaf Awareness Week (4th-10th May 2020) and was interviewed by Product &amp; Technology's Talent Acquisition team for the 'Future Leaders' series which people get invited to interview to cover a person's perspective, and how they got into technology in the first place.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here's the links to the articles!</p>

<li><a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/communication-tips-with-deaf-people-at-work-fd7b172e0e1c">Communication tips with Deaf people at work</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Future weeknotes</h2>
<p>The next few weeknotes will be more of an explanatory of the learning journey I undergo with AWS (Amazon Web Services) for work. I hope to make it a version of a glossary that could be explained to a five year old, and would be useful for future me as well.</p>
<p>Until then ðŸ‘‹</p>
