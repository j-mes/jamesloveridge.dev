				<h1>How warm is January?</h1>
				&lt;h2&gt;January (so far)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever come across a January where it&#39;s been this warm. I&#39;m not even taking along a scarf, gloves and a hat to muddle through when going outside from home. It really does make me think about climate change, and how I could be more responsible for my own carbon footprint. Going to work by train reduces my carbon footprint a lot more than if I went by car. I wouldn&#39;t go to work by car, as it&#39;s in the City of London, the parking fees would be atrocious, not to mention the goddamned traffic. I have thought about entertaining the option of going full time flexitarian to do my bit for the planet. I&#39;m currently struggling of what would allow for occasional eating of meat? How often could this happen? It&#39;s something to ponder about along with the 1000 things I&#39;m already thinking about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;His Dark Materials - The Subtle Knife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently going through the 2nd book &#39;The Subtle Knife&#39; on the commute. This makes for a nice change than the usual reads that I go through. I had read the first book years ago, watched the film (which was not great) and enjoyed the TV (BBC) iteration immensely. I thought that was nicely done, and had the right amount of darkness to it. Anyway, onto the book. This has taken a new direction, and it&#39;s quite pleasant. The characters that I&#39;ve been reading along with so far, have explored a few worlds with some differences. It&#39;s fascinating and I do not want to spoil the book if you stumble across this post somehow, even though I&#39;ve not advertised the site at all. No analytics, no SEO, no crap like that. ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouGotThis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m particularly interested in seeing the talks in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://2020.yougotthis.io/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; which I am going to tomorrow. As one of the main goals for me, in this fresh new year is to go up another level as a Software Engineer. I wonder if some of the talks will provide me with an insight of what I could do to facilitate that possibility at the Financial Times. Time will tell! ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;
