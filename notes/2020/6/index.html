				<h1>BSL, clay pigeon shooting &amp; adulting</h1>
				&lt;p&gt;Hello February! It&#39;s a chilly start, with fogs forming almost most of every morning so far when I&#39;ve gotten up and dragged myself out from the warm bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;British Sign Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 1st February, I went clay pigeon shooting with my dad and a friend Ben &lt;em&gt;(spoiler alert - I won)&lt;/em&gt;. I was using the money from the culture award that I won at work, for helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_magspie&quot;&gt;Maggie Allen&lt;/a&gt; run British Sign Language taster sessions. We have helped a lot of people learn the basics of the British Sign Language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com&quot;&gt;FT&lt;/a&gt; really inclusive, is the people. They are always willing and are open minded enough to try new things that are outside of their comfort zone. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever experienced that anywhere else, and I feel very fortunate to work at a company that encourages staff to do so. In some cases they thrive and progress in their careers quicker as a result. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing more new faces for the taster sessions this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clay pigeon shooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was 13, I&#39;ve been super lucky that my dad would take me clay pigeon shooting, and show the patience and guidance to show me how to shoot. Fast forward a few years of shooting every now and then. For a birthday a few years ago, I brought all of my mates, and some of the family. Feeling reasonably confident that I would come first, and ended up rock bottom. I was completely sideswiped by this, and it did dent my confidence a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little chat with the old boy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTK0IPLhImw&quot;&gt;Doug Florent&lt;/a&gt; that owns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordguncompany.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Oxford Gun Company&lt;/a&gt;. He gave me some pieces of advice on how to hold the gun, and so on. Going from 60% accuracy to near 70% was amazing in itself. Having a right fitted gun (even if its a hired one) is another one. I had an ill-fitted shotgun on Saturday, and it wasn&#39;t really pleasant to deal with. It really makes me think about getting my own and to have the right fit, and try and push above 70% accuracy and see if I can even get 50/50 (this is really difficult to achieve) on a Sporting day to be in for a chance to win a prize. I &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; managed to get 56% this time around, which was not great, as the previous visits had me at 65%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&#39;m shit at being an adult‚Ñ¢Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to having a new sofa and armchair for the living room. It looks great, and is comfortable. Now to do the rest of the house, and make sure I have enough tea bags, milk, biscuits for visitors that will come tomorrow. Oh and tidy up the rest of the house before they come. &lt;em&gt;Fuck&lt;/em&gt;. I reckon I can smash it all out of the park if I get up really early on Saturday morning right? We shall see üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then üëã&lt;/p&gt;
