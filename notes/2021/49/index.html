				<h1>Jess</h1>
				&lt;h2&gt;A letter to Jess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day we got you from a dog fostering family (with Dogs&#39; Trust) in the summer of 2008, was a day that I and dad didn&#39;t realise how much of an impact you would have on the family for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going for walks with you was always an memorable time, because as a young dog you wouldn&#39;t come back. Despite numerous attempts to try and retrieve you, and calling your name repeatedly until you had enough which usually made a hour walk turn into 2 hours and half at times! At the time I would be furious but now I smile as I recollect the fond memories of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tried to vary the walking routes so that you&#39;d have lots of different smells and places to explore. You were such a good sport at playing fetch or rounding up my sister&#39;s kids. You certainly touched a lot of hearts being part of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were such an intelligent and brilliant dog, and life indeed is a bit more duller without you being there to take for a walk, or to play games with. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky to have been part of your life, and that we will miss you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Jess ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

So here&#39;s one of my favourite photos of Jess. This photo was taken in the morning on 10th August 2019 at my parents&#39; home.&lt;/p&gt;
