				<h1>Jess</h1>
				<h2>A letter to Jess</h2>
<p>The day we got you from a dog fostering family (with Dogs' Trust) in the summer of 2008, was a day that I and dad didn't realise how much of an impact you would have on the family for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Going for walks with you was always an memorable time, because as a young dog you wouldn't come back. Despite numerous attempts to try and retrieve you, and calling your name repeatedly until you had enough which usually made a hour walk turn into 2 hours and half at times! At the time I would be furious but now I smile as I recollect the fond memories of this happening.</p>
<p>I always tried to vary the walking routes so that you'd have lots of different smells and places to explore. You were such a good sport at playing fetch or rounding up my sister's kids. You certainly touched a lot of hearts being part of the family.</p>
<p>You were such an intelligent and brilliant dog, and life indeed is a bit more duller without you being there to take for a walk, or to play games with. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky to have been part of your life, and that we will miss you very much.</p>
<p>Thank you Jess ❤️</p>
