				<h1 class="note__page-title">Hello intermittent notes, my old friend</h1>
				<p>A new year, a new James? Or is it more like 'Different year, same James'? ü§£</p>
<ul>
<li>I got shamed at work by <a href="https://rowanmanning.com/">Rowan</a> for not posting any notes for a long time after I mentioned that one of his <a href="https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/166/">weeknotes</a> had me in giggles. What a character Rowan's grandmother is! So here you go, I've littered your RSS feed reader with something that's nowhere near as useful then üòè</li>
<li>I have had an incredibly busy festive period with my family, and I am actually looking forward to January as that's when people are more antisocial right? Which would let me stay at home and potter around to my own devices right?</li>
<li>I'm massively looking forward to going to Spa Valley Heritage Railway tomorrow with Kit. Experiencing a preserved Steam locomotive with its noise, smells and how it goes over the rails with old carriages behind to ride in, is a wonderful experience and <em>everyone</em> should do it at least once every year!</li>
<li>I'll try and write an intermittent note every Friday‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<h2>Under the hood improvements</h2>
<p>I did make some improvements to the website, which isn't very visible to anyone who isn't a web developer or a software engineer stalking me on GitHub. So here goes what I've done to the site since my last intermittent note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the broken RSS feed file</li>
<li>Add CSS compilation on build &amp; deploy (No more committing compiled CSS files!)</li>
<li>Added <code>data-attributes</code> to the pages on the site (I'll write more on this later) for the future plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do something better with the homepage than duplicating what <a href="https://jamesloveridge.dev/notes/">Notes</a> is.</li>
<li>Fix the order of the posts in the years on Notes so that it's in reverse order of when it was published.</li>
<li>Add more categories of other things (yet to be announced).</li>
<li>Write a 'About' page and put it in.</li>
<li>Use data-attributes for each page to do specific styling</li>
<li>Add in my old long form articles under 'Writing' and use specific styling for it (old university things).</li>
</ul>
<p>Until then üëã</p>
