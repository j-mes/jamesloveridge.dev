<p>Thankfully this week has not been -5Â°C and has been relatively warm. However this is January, it is meant to be freezing all month, it worries me what the temperatures will be like in the future.</p>

<p>It's absolutely fascinating how a single character change at work from a system further upstream from Lantern or Pink Lantern can just break things. It turned out that a change from <code>article</code> to <code>Article</code> brought all of this chaos downstream, and as I love seeing things break because then people can learn and fix them to prevent it from happening in the future. What the we as a team has learned is that we should write more defensive code in the future and not assume everything will be <code>lowercase</code>, <code>uppercase</code>, or <code>capitalize</code> in whatever form it may be. Utterly fascinating ðŸ˜…</p>

<p>A colleague shared in the Engineering channel this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bytebytego_systemdesign-coding-interviewtips-activity-7156542626446344192-nmBJ">wonderful post</a>. It's about which programming languages is indeed the most greenest for the planet. I could believe <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, but C and C++ surely not? I do wonder where they are basing their data from. JavaScript is 17th out of 27 languages. Rust is on the horizon for me to learn a little bit. Maybe something to do soon. Hmm.</p>

<p>Until then ðŸ‘‹</p>
