Well, for a number of weeks I haven't really felt like documenting or writing week notes. The massive life shift with the pandemic has been a challenge to adapt to, and unfortunately my weeknotes fell by the side. The FT has made the ['Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreads'](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest) article free for anyone to read and consume, and it is regularly up to date. I hope to not write anything more further about coronavirus in the weeknotes from now.

## Deaf Awareness Week

Last week I published two Medium posts for Deaf Awareness Week (4th-10th May 2020) and was interviewed by Product & Technology's Talent Acquisition team for the 'Future Leaders' series which people get invited to interview to cover a person's perspective, and how they got into technology in the first place.

So, without further ado, here's the links to the articles!

## Future weeknotes

The next few weeknotes will be more of an explanatory of the learning journey I undergo with AWS (Amazon Web Services) for work. I hope to make it a version of a glossary that could be explained to a five year old, and would be useful for future me as well.

Until then ðŸ‘‹
