Hello hello! Rather than explain why I've not kept this up to date, I'd say what has changed since the last time I wrote something here.

* Got promoted at work to Senior Software Engineer in March and I'm still breaking things dailyâ€¦ (idiots ðŸ˜†)
* Stopped playing World of Warcraft (more on this at a later date)
* Started playing Overwatch 2 a _lot_ more!
* Went to Lisbon in May for a few days with 2 friends.
* Going to Barcelona in October with 3 friends. I can't wait to see the city and to venture out to Montserrat too.
* My sodding gas boiler broke, and I'm now having to find a gas safe engineer to do a replacement boiler and all the additional work to go along with it.

I'm actually looking forward to the football season which starts tonight. It'll be interesting to see if my beloved Arsenal will go one step further this time and win the sodding thing instead of fading away in the last few games like last seasonâ€¦

Until then ðŸ‘‹
