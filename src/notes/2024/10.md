* Dear reader, I'm writing a quick intermittent note on my birthday, mostly because I have a little bit space in my day to do this as I have booked the entire week off from work so I could do things that aren't work related. Despite writing about work and AI in the next pointâ€¦

* One of the new things at work, this year especially is that they have embraced AI with open arms in order not to be caught out or left behind in the cold. I've been intrigued to what it can do, and one of the possibilities that it could help me is to spot any gaps in the tests that I'll have written via [GitHub Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). I've been playing around with Gemini and ChatGPT as well in very short bursts so I'm intrigued to see what GitHub Co-Pilot will do differently for me and whenever it'll get in the way or not. Time will tell.

* Kit has given me a wonderful surprise for my birthday, we are to go to Rome, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ tomorrow for a few days. I'm looking forward to seeing the [Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum), [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel) and other places there in Rome! I'll share some photos in the next intermittent note ðŸ™‚

Arrivederci ðŸ‘‹
