title: A single character change
date: 2024-01-26

* Thankfully this week has not been -5Â°C and has been relatively warm. However this is January, it is meant to be freezing all month, it worries me what the temperatures will be like in the future.

* It's absolutely fascinating how a single character change at work from a system further upstream from Lantern or Pink Lantern can just break things. It turned out that a change from `article` to `Article` brought all of this chaos downstream, and as I love seeing things break because then people can learn and fix them to prevent it from happening in the future. What the we as a team has learned is that we should write more defensive code in the future and not assume everything will be `lowercase`, `uppercase`, or `capitalize` in whatever form it may be. Utterly fascinating ðŸ˜…

* A colleague shared in the Engineering channel this [wonderful post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bytebytego_systemdesign-coding-interviewtips-activity-7156542626446344192-nmBJ). It's about which programming languages is indeed the most greenest for the planet. I could believe [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but C and C++ surely not? I do wonder where they are basing their data from. JavaScript is 17th out of 27 languages. Rust is on the horizon for me to learn a little bit. Maybe something to do soon. Hmm.

Until then ðŸ‘‹
